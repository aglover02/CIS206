"""
BMI Calculator (Imperial to Metric) with Validation, Error Handling, and Looping.

This program prompts the user to enter their weight in pounds,
and their height in feet and inches. It then calculates the
Body Mass Index (BMI) using the imperial formula:

    BMI = (weight_lbs / (total_height_in)**2) * 703

Enhancements:
- Validation and exception handling.
- Re-prompts user instead of terminating on invalid input.
- User can type "q" to quit the program at any time.
- Main program loops to allow multiple BMI calculations until user quits.

    Raises:

        - Accepts "q" at any prompt to quit.
