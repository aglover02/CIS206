"""
BMI Calculator (Imperial to Metric) with Validation and Error Handling

This program prompts the user to enter their weight in pounds,
and their height in feet and inches. It then calculates the
Body Mass Index (BMI) using the imperial formula:

    BMI = (weight_lbs / (total_height_in)**2) * 703

Validation and exception handling have been added:
- Data type validation and range validation.
- Assertions to confirm calculated values are reasonable.
- Exception handling with try/except blocks.
- Nested if statements used within validation.
- Re-prompts user instead of terminating on invalid input.
- User can type "q" to quit the program at any time.
